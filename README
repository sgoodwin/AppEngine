AppEngine is a convenient web-service to handle the following aspects of Mac OSX program deployment:

- Generate xml file for Sparkle.
- Manage application releases (control which apps show in the sparkle feed, etc).
- Store usage data submitted by Sparkle and generate a summary.
- Store in-app user-feedback submissions and generate a summary.
